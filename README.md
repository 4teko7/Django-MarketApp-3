  <p>
    <i>
      I created this application for some institutions which are market, shops etc. People can upload images of the products,
      and can add ingredients of them. Customers can order without registration. They just enter their information and push order button.
      People who registered and login can edit their profile. Address, name, surname, username, profile img, etc can be edited.
      In main they can see products they have ordered so far, and products which are currently prepared. Admin can make many things.
      For example, He can change state of orders, can delete or add product, product gredients, user , etc. There are many things to say, You can look some images which I uploaded.
